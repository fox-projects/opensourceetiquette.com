		<h1>Open Source Software Etiquette</h1>
		<p>
			Thank you for being involved in an open-source project! You were probably linked to
			this page because someone thought you did not practice open-source software
			etiquette.
		</p>
		<p>
			Below are some guidelines, ordered roughly by what (I think) is important. This site
			is for people that comment on issues or pull requests.
		</p>
		<p>
			These items are <em>additions</em> on top of standard netiquette guidelines (<a

			<h2>
				Most open-source maintainers volunteer their time and money to write code (that's
				often freely distributable). <em>Be decent</em>
			</h2>
			<p>
				For example, it would be disrespectful to berate a soup kitchen volunteer for
				making an honest mistake. Or, if a gardener was providing the fruits of their
				labor to their community, it would be indecent to tell that gardener how
				<em>you</em> think they should garden if you were a passerbyer.

			<h2><em>Please</em> properly format your issues</h2>
			<p>
				Maintainers often put time into <em>reading</em> and <em>responding</em> to
				issues. The <em>least</em> you could do is spent time to write an issue that's
				easy to read and understand. This isn't targeted at people where English is not
				their first language, but people who know better when filling an issue. If you are
				using Google Translate (looking at your Americans!), it is your responsibility to
				specify that you're using it, and write things in simple terms so translation is
				successful. Code is the least common denominator across languages, so use that to
				your advantage.
			</p>
			<p>
				See this
				<a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet">Markdown cheat sheet</a>. If
				there is an issue template, fill it out <em>to the best of your ability.</em>
